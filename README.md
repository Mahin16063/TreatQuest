# TreatQuest
TreatQuest is a playful RL challenge where you teach a virtual pet to collect treats while avoiding “traps” in a 2D grid. The pet starts clueless, wandering around, but through trial-and-error it learns which moves bring rewards and which don’t. By the end, you’ll have a smart companion that finds the fastest route to snacks!
